# Meme Ninja

## Description

Get ready to slice your way through the memecoin madness! In Meme Ninja, you take on the role of a ninja facing a barrage of falling memecoins. Slice them before your capital (life bar) runs out!

This is a simple web-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the Canvas API for graphics and Howler.js for sound.
